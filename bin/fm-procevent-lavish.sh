# Usage:
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh arm <artifact.html> [--for <task-id>] [--agent-reply-file <path>]
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh classify <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh terminal <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh silent <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh answers <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh reconciles <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh read <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh source-id <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh retire <artifact.html>
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh poll <artifact.html> [--agent-reply-file <path>]
#   fm-procevent-lavish.sh deliver-reply poll <artifact.html> --agent-reply-file <path>
#
# classify   Print the lifecycle state a handler should act on: feedback, ended,
#            waiting, disconnected, missing, or unknown.
# read       Print a structured presentation of one already-captured result so a
#            handler consumes every queued item without grepping the raw file.
#            It is read-only over the capture: it does not arm, poll, or change
#            what Lavish delivered. The freeform message (tag=message) is its
#            own labeled field, printed first and distinct from per-element
#            annotations; it is labeled SESSION-ENDING MESSAGE only when the
#            session ended. Declared and presented item counts,
#            plus a completeness verdict, follow before all annotations so a
#            partial read is obvious; a content block in neither published
#            shape is never certified complete. Each annotation retains its
#            element uid, selector, tag, and text; a message keeps any non-empty
#            uid, selector, or text beside its body. Every other field of an
#            annotation or message, nested ones included, is presented
#            flattened under target, attachments, or fields; an item whose
#            nested content cannot be parsed is counted unpresented and never
#            certified complete. A non-choice freeform comment (`prompt`)
#            is printed as its own field even when a selector is also present
#            and even when that comment matches the element text, so typed
#            words are never dropped. Choice Context data is not a comment.
#            Captain-supplied body lines are visibly prefixed so they cannot
#            forge structural labels. Empty message and annotation sections
#            are reported explicitly.
# poll       The registered listener command `arm` publishes, not a command to
#            run in a conversational turn. It runs the published blocking poll
#            and prints its response verbatim, absorbing only the one exact
#            transient interruption described below. A staged reply still
#            present when it starts is posted before the long-poll: through
#            `lavish-axi reply` when supported, otherwise through the legacy
#            best-effort `poll --agent-reply` path.
# deliver-reply
#            Run by `fm-procevent.sh register-task` under the source lock, only
#            after the task is eligible to own the board, with the listener argv
#            it is about to publish. Exit 0 once Lavish accepts the staged reply,
#            3 when the installed Lavish is a confirmed older release without
#            synchronous reply so the listener keeps the legacy path, and any
#            other status when the reply failed or the version is unknown.
# terminal   Exit 0 when the captured result means this Lavish source will never
#            produce another result, so the runner may retire it; any other exit
#            keeps it armed. This is the generic adapter contract bin/fm-procevent.sh
#            calls, and the only place Lavish's notion of "ended" is decided.
# silent     Exit 0 when the captured result is a routine no-op the runner should
#            record and never announce; any other exit publishes the wake. This
#            is the generic no-op contract bin/fm-procevent.sh calls, and the
#            only place Lavish's notion of "nothing was said" is decided.
#            Task-owned terminal rounds bypass generic silence so their owner
#            receives the stop-and-conclude instruction.
#
# AN EMPTY BOARD CLOSE IS NOT NEWS, and that is what `silent` exists to say.
# Closing a review surface that carried nothing is the single most common Lavish
# result: the captain reads a board, says nothing, and closes it. Announcing that
# put a wake in front of the handler whose entire content was that nothing
# happened. `silent` therefore holds two narrow, positively-determined shapes -
# a session this adapter classifies `ended` that carries no queued content block
# at all, or `browser_disconnected`, which carries no answer while the session
# remains open - and every other result stays announced.
#
# Deliberately narrow, in both directions. A `Send & End` close carrying the
# captain's actual answer arrives as `status: feedback` with `session_ended`, so
# it classifies `feedback`, never `ended`, and is announced exactly as before; so
# is any `ended` result that still carries a `prompts` or `feedback` block, which
# the published poll is not expected to produce but which must never be dropped
# on that expectation. A `waiting` session, a `missing` one, an `unknown` or
# unreadable result, and any error all stay announced, because none of them
# positively proves nothing was said. Silence is only ever an absence this
# adapter can see in the result, never an absence it assumes.
#
# This adapter is deliberately thin. It owns only what is specific to Lavish:
# canonical source identity, the argv for the currently published poll command,
# and how to read a completed result. Ownership, durable capture, publication,
# and restart recovery all belong to bin/fm-procevent.sh.
#
# The published poll vocabulary includes feedback, ended, waiting, and
# browser_disconnected. A waiting result from this no-timeout poll means a
# second poller was present; it is not a normal idle round. browser_disconnected
# means the session remains open and is handled as a silent reconnect wait.
# Before each poll attempt, resolve the artifact's saved URL from Lavish's own
# session store (LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR/state.json, default ~/.lavish-axi/state.json)
# and use its host and port. Opening the board writes that URL; polling does not.
# This is a routing lookup before the blocking call, not presence polling or a
# second route record. Ambient/configured addresses must not retarget a reply.
# An unreadable or missing session stops before the staged reply is consumed.
#
# `answers` is this adapter's half of the generic keyed-answer contract in
# bin/fm-procevent.sh. It reports what the captain actually chose, as
# `<task-id>\t<answer>\t<label>` lines, and stops there. It maps nothing to a
# task, records no decision, and closes nothing: a captain answer is not special
# to Lavish, so every rule about what a keyed answer DOES belongs to the one
# intake in bin/fm-captain-hold.sh, which the runner feeds. A Lavish review is
# just an ephemeral discussion format that happens to carry answers.
#
# Only rows tagged `choice` are read. A freeform captain message is prose that may
# contain anything, and must never be able to forge a decision key.
#
# `read` is the presentation command summarized above; keyed intake remains
# the separate `answers` contract described here.
#
# It wraps the published `lavish-axi poll` and `lavish-axi reply` interfaces,
# verified against 0.1.80. `poll` long-polls indefinitely; `reply` exits only
# after the server confirms acceptance. Older compatible versions retain the
# legacy poll-with-reply path, without the synchronous handoff guarantee.
#
# BOUNDED QUIET RETRY, owned here and nowhere else. A live listener can be cut
# short by the server with exactly this two-line response while the session's
# marks remain available:
#
#   error: Lavish Editor poll response was interrupted
#   code: SERVER_ERROR
#
# That is an internal retry, not news, so registering the raw poll made the
# generic runner capture it and wake the whole fleet. `poll` therefore re-runs
# the published poll up to POLL_RETRY_LIMIT times for that exact response, with
# attempt starts at least POLL_RETRY_DELAY_DEFAULT seconds apart. The match is exact and
# deliberately narrow: real feedback, ended and missing sessions, any other
# SERVER_ERROR, and the same interruption still standing after the bound is
# spent are all printed straight through and captured normally. The retry is a
# Lavish fact, so the generic runner in bin/fm-procevent.sh stays
# adapter-agnostic and learns nothing about it.
#
# LOSS LIMITATION, stated plainly. The published poll destructively clears
# feedback before returning it. A result lost after that clearing and before the
# runner reads the process output is unrecoverable, and no Firstmate wrapper can
# close that source-side handoff window. Never describe this path as
# at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless. The only durability this proves is the
# runner's own: output that reached the runner is stored before it is announced.

# THE QUEUED-CONTENT BLOCK, owned here for every consumer below. The published
# response is TOON, which frames queued content as a top-level `prompts[N]` or
# `feedback[N]` array in one of two shapes. When every item is a flat object
# with the same keys it is TABULAR: a `prompts[N]{field,...}:` header followed
# by N indented CSV rows. Otherwise - for example when an item carries a nested
# `target` object or an `attachments` array - it is a LIST: a `prompts[N]:`
# header followed by N indented `- key: value` items whose further fields sit
# two columns deeper. A list item's nested objects and arrays, in any TOON
# shape, are flattened into dotted and indexed fields such as
# `target.start.path[0]` or `attachments[0].name`; an item whose nested content
# cannot be parsed is counted as unpresented, so no consumer can certify it as
# fully read. Both shapes must
# reach the handler, so each consumer reads the block through LAVISH_ITEMS_PERL
# rather than its own header match. The header anchors on
# column zero: an indented payload line is captain-supplied text and must never
# be able to forge a content header. A top-level prompts or feedback line that
# is neither shape is unparsed, and every consumer treats that as incomplete
# rather than as an empty block.
